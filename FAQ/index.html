            <p>
              Depending on the type of website you handle, you might need a FAQ.
              Try to take note of all the questions you get asked multiple times
              regarding your services, and create a FAQ to answer them. This
              will save you some time in the future hopefully.

            <p>
              This tutorial will help you understand, how to create interactive
              and dynamic behavioral components on the website. Once you make
              this component, you can keep on reusing it for any website you
              will make in future, because most of the websites for any type of
              services in one way or the other will need a FAQ page.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Of course, you can change the colors, sizing, icons, effects of
              different elements here as per your design needs by keeping it
              simple and elegant. But meanwhile, the core interactive
              functionality of the component shouldn't get disturbed.

          <a class="faq-question">Will I need to use JavaScript here?</a>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Well, that's the task for you to decide. If you can make this
              component work without using JavaScript then sure, go ahead.
